  <div class="lyrics">
    <p>All my friends tell me I should move on</p>
    <p> I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song</p>
    <p> Ahh</p>
    <p>  That's how you sang it</p>
    <p>  Loving you forever can't be wrong</p>
    <p> Even though you're not here, won't move on</p>
    <p> Ahh</p>
    <p> That's how we played it</p>
    <p> And there's no remedy for memory, your face is like a melody</p>
    <p> It won't leave my head</p>
    <p>  Your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine</p>
    <p> But I wish I was dead (dead, like you)</p>
    <p> Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise</p>
    <p> No one compares to you</p>
    <p> I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side</p>
    <p> Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise</p>
    <p> No one compares to you</p>
    <p> I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side</p>
    <p> All my friends ask me why I stay strong</p>
    <p>Tell 'em when you find true love, it lives on</p>
    <p>Ahh</p>
    <p>That's why I stay here</p>
    <p>And there's no remedy for memory, your face is like a melody</p>
    <p>It won't leave my head</p>
    <p>Your soul is haunting me and telling me that everything is fine</p>
    <p>But I wish I was dead (dead, like you)</p>
    <p>Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise</p>
    <p>No one compares to you</p>
    <p>I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side</p>
    <p>Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise</p>
    <p>No one compares to you</p>
    <p>But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight</p>
    <p>Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah</p>
    <p>I don't want to wake up from this tonight</p>
    <p>Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah</p>
    <p>I don't want to wake up from this tonight</p>
    <p>There's no relief, I see you in my sleep</p>
    <p>And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me</p>
    <p>There's no release, I feel you in my dreams</p>
    <p>Telling me I'm fine</p>
    <p>Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise</p>
    <p>No one compares to you</p>
    <p>I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side</p>
    <p>Every time I close my eyes, it's like a dark paradise</p>
    <p>No one compares to you</p>
    <p>But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight</p>
    <p>Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah</p>
    <p>I don't want to wake up from this tonight</p>
    <p>Oh-oh-oh-oh-hah-hah-hah-hah</p>
    <p>I don't want to wake up from this tonight</p>
